# solutionBreakdowns
A place to record and discuss the solutions to the problem exercises I do. The repository is named "Breakdowns" but it would be more accurate to say "retrospectives" as I am recording my thoughts on them, as well as the lessons I learned from them.

Many of these problems have solutions posted online. The purpose of this repository is to help me synthesize any information I gain while I solve these problems.
