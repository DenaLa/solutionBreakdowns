The folder for Geek For Geek's [160 Days of Problem Solving Course](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg160-160-days-of-problem-solving/)

The full solutions to each of these problems are available within the course. As such, the entries in this folder will only be of the information and new perspectives I internalized with each presented solution.

DISCLAIMER: I do not have the free time of a student, so I do look at the solution's code as a way to study. Instead of copying and pasting said code, I instead analyze it to understand how it works. For that reason, there might be minor discrepencies between the code presented in this repository, and the code that is actually listed in the "Articles" section of each problem.
