The folder for Geek For Geek's [160 Days of Problem Solving Course](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg160-160-days-of-problem-solving/)

The full solutions to each of these problems are available within the course. As such, the entries in this folder will only be of the information and new perspectives I internalized with each presented solution.

It should be noted that I do not look at any actual written code unless there is something I do not understand with the algorithm or if my own code has notable deficiencies that affect the solution. If I do so, I will note it.
