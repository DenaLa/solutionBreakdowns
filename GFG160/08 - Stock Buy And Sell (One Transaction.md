This problem is similar to the last problem. We have to look at a given array, and see when's the best day to buy, and the best day to sell. The catch now, is that we can only make one transaction. So we have to make it count.

This problem's solution came a bit easier to me than the last. To me it was simple- Keep track of the smallest number, and keep track of the largest difference. I tried to get fancy and use a for each loop in order to familiarize myself with it more, but as I wrote my solution, I realized it wouldn't work. I was a bit heartbroken.

The real star I should have been using was the min and max functions that come with Math. I had just typed out my conditionals as normal before submitting, and double checked with the proposed solution code to make sure things lined up. And when I had seen how much neater reducing 3 lines of code (because I like to make my conditional statements obvious, even if they are only one line) to one was, I felt a bit sheepish. So I cleaned up and used the built in min and max functions that came with Math. And thus, ends my journey with this problem.

There is a nested loop solution to this problem. It involves comparisons. The time complexity is very bad, so it never crossed my mind in the first place. I do feel like my aversion to nested loops will need to be overcome at some point.
