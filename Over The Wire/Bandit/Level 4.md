"The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory."

To see hidden files in a directory, we can use the ```ls -la``` command. We can also simply use the ```ls -a``` command, but I like the formatting of the former more. One thing to note is that you can't tab to autocomplete on hidden files.
