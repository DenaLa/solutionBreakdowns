"The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game."

Relatively easy. Once you log in, you can use ```cat readme``` to get your password and get out. I had done an ls before hand just to make sure it was in there.
