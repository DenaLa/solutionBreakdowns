A collection of [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) Retrospectives.

I believe that it's against the rules to post any of the credentials. But, I believe I can still post the solutions somewhat, so far as any credentials are not featured inside. I will keep the fun for everyone.

These are **not** intended to be tutorials. These are intended to be write ups on how I solved each problem. They are meant to reflect my path of studying from start to finish. I will rely on outside help and information, because as of now, I am a novice. And in general, if I get stuck, research is the only way I will pull myself out, regardless of skill level.
