A collection of [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) Retrospectives.

I believe that it's against the rules to post any of the credentials. But, I believe I can still post the solutions somewhat, so far as any credentials are not featured inside.

These are **not** intended to be tutorials. This is a reword of me studying. Many entries are dry because (at the current level, bandit), the solutions are primarily knowing which commands to use and where.

I will be using [this blog](https://mayadevbe.me/) to help me study.

As I am on a windows machine, I am using cygwin as my terminal.
